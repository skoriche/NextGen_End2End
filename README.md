# Next-Generation Framework Sandbox Hub (NextGenSandboxHub)
[NextGen](https://github.com/NOAA-OWP/ngen), Next-Generation Water Resources Modeling Framework, developed by the NOAA's Office of Water Prediction is a standards-based language- and model-agnostic framework, which allows to run a mosaic of surface and subsurface models in a single basin comprised of 10s-100s sub-catchments. 

## Schematic of the NextGenSandboxHub workflow

## Configuration
Note: The workflow assumes that [ngen](https://github.com/NOAA-OWP/ngen) and other models have already been built, including [t-route](https://github.com/NOAA-OWP/t-route). It is also assumed that both ngen and t-route were built within a Python environment named `.venv_ngen`.

### <ins>  Step 1. Clone Repository
  - `git clone https://github.com/ajkhattak/NextGenSandboxHub && cd NextGenSandboxHub`
  - `git submodule update --init`

### <ins>  Step 2. Hydrofabric Installation
Ensure R and Rtools are already installed before proceeding. There are two ways to install the required packages:
  #### Option 1: Using RStudio
  1. Open RStudio
  2. Load and run the installation script by sourcing it:
     - Open `<path_to_sandboxhub>/src_r/install_load_libs.R` in RStudio.
     - Click Source to execute the script.
     - Alternatively, run the following command in the RStudio Console:
       ```
       source("~/<path_to_sandboxhub>/src_r/install_load_libs.R")
       ```
  #### Option 2: Using the Command Line
  Run the following command in a terminal or command prompt:
  ```
   Rscript <path_to_sandboxhub>/src_r/install_load_libs.R
  ```

### <ins> Step 3. Hydrofabric Subsetting
  - Dependency: Step 2
  - Download domain (CONUS or oCONUS) from [lynker-spatial](https://www.lynker-spatial.com/data?path=hydrofabric%2Fv2.2%2F), for instance conus/conus_nextgen.gpkg
  - open `<path_to_sandboxhub>/configs/config_workflow.yaml` [here](configs/config_workflow.yaml) and adjust workflow_dir, input_dir, output_dir, and gpkg_model_params according to your local settings
  - Now there are two options to proceed:
      - run `python <path_to_sandboxhub>/main.py -gpkg`
      - or open `<path_to_sandboxhub>/src_r/main.R` in RStudio and source on main.R. Note Set file name `infile_config` [here](https://github.com/ajkhattak/basin_workflow/blob/nwm-v4-bm/src_r/main.R#L54) 
    
    Either one will install the hydrofabric and several other libraries, and if everything goes well, a basin geopackage will be subsetted and stored under `<input_dir>/<basin_id>/data/gage_<basin_id>.gpkg`

### <ins> Step 4. Forcing Data Download
The workflow uses [CIROH_DL_NextGen](https://github.com/ajkhattak/CIROH_DL_NextGen) forcing_prep tool to donwload atmospheric forcing data.
  - `mkdir ~/.venv_forcing`
  - `python -m venv ~/.venv_forcing`
  - `source ~/.venv_forcing/bin/activate`
  - `pip install -r extern/CIROH_DL_NextGen/forcing_prep/requirements.txt`
  - open `<path_to_sandboxhub>/configs/config_workflow.yaml` [here](configs/config_workflow.yaml) and setup `forcings` block
  - To download the forcing data run:
    ```
    python <path_to_sandboxhub>/main.py -forc
    ```
    
### <ins> Step 5. NGEN-CAL and Plugins Installation
  - Activate the Python Virtual Environment (Ensure .venv_ngen exists and ngen was built within this environment):
    ```
    source <path_to_venv>/.venv_ngen/bin/activate
    ```
  - Install NGEN-CAL (Run this command from within the <path_to_sandboxhub> directory):
    ```
    pip install "extern/ngen-cal/python/ngen_cal[netcdf]"
    ```
  - Install NGEN-CAL Plugins (Run this command from within the <path_to_sandboxhub> directory):
    ```
    pip install -e ./extern/ngen_cal_plugins
    ```
    
### <ins>  Step 6. Generate Configuration and Realization Files
To generate configuratioin and realization files, setup the `formulation` block in the workflow config file [here](configs/config_workflow.yaml), and run the following command:
 ```
    python <path_to_sandboxhub>/main.py -conf
 ```

### <ins> Step 7. Run Calibration/Validation Simulations
Setup the `ngen_cal` block in the workflow config file [here](configs/config_workflow.yaml), and run the following command, note this depends on all of the above steps:
 ```
    python <path_to_sandboxhub>/main.py -run
 ```

#### Summary
1. Subset divide using hydrofabric
2. Download forcing data
3. Generate configuration files
4. Run Simulations: Using
  ```
    python <path_to_sandboxhub>/main.py option
    OPTIONS = [-gpkg -forc -conf -run]
  ```
- Option: `-gpkg` downloads geopackage(s) given a gage ID(s), extracts and locally compute TWI, GIUH, and Nash Cascade parameters; see `divide-attributes` in the gage_<basin_id>.gpkg file
- Option: `-forc` downloads geopackage(s) given a gage ID(s)
- Option: `-conf` generates configuration and realization files for the selected models/basins
- Option: `-run` executes NextGen simulations with and without calibration

Note: These options can be run individually or combined together, for example, `path_to/main.py -gpkg -conf -run`. The `-gpkg` is an expensive step, should be run once to get the desired basin geopacakge and associated model parameters.
